# My Learning Log

IPython notebooks of notes I take while working through programming books, organized first by topic, then by title.

Each book chapter has its own notebook, named using the structure `Chapternn.ipynb`. For some (all?!) chapters there is also a `ChapternnPractice.ipynb` file, in which I apply what was covered in different or novel ways.

### Books Covered

[Python for Data Analysis (1st edition)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lukewrites/Learning-Log/blob/master/data_science/python_for_data_analysis/Chapter00.ipynb)


### Topics covered

#### Web Scraping
[Bellevue Leafs](https://github.com/lukewrites/Learning-Log/tree/master/web_scraping/playground) – tracking the price of used Nissan Leafs, and doing some data analysis.
