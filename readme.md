# My Learning Log

IPython notebooks of notes I take while working through programming books, organized first by topic, then by title.

Each book chapter has its own notebook, named using the structure `Chapter nn.ipynb`. For some (all?!) chapters there is also a `Chapter nn practice.ipynb` file, in which I apply what was covered in different or novel ways.

### Books Covered

[Python for Data Analysis (1st edition)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lukewrites/Learning-Log/blob/master/data_science/python_for_data_analysis/Chapter00.ipynb)
